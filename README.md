YouTube data harvesting and warehousing can refer to the process of collecting large amounts of data from YouTube and storing it in databases or data warehouses for various purposes. This data can include information about videos, users, comments, likes, views, and more.

Data harvesting from YouTube typically involves using web scraping techniques to extract information from YouTube's publicly available web pages. 
This can be done manually or using automated tools. The harvested data is then stored in databases or data warehouses where it can be analyzed, processed, and used for different purposes such as market research, trend analysis, content recommendation, and targeted advertising.
